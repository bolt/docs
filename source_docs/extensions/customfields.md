Extensions: Providing Custom Fields
===================================

The release of Bolt 3.0 has seen a significant amount of power and flexibility added to custom fields. In the 
2.x series of releases custom fields did not have access to the entire lifecycle of a field and was focused
more on providing replacement templates for the built in storage types.

With this in mind, the following tutorial is a reworking of the one originally written for the 2.x documentation,
it no longer represents best practice for custom field development, for that please see the latest tutorial here.

What this updated tutorial will be useful for is to see what changes will be needed to update field extensions
to be compatible with Bolt 3.0

#### Task: Add a Colour Picker to Bolt

Wouldn't it be good if we could allow editors of your site to add a splash of colour to a page banner?

Possibly not, but that's no reason to not try, so we're going to add a new field type to Bolt that allows content 
editors to pick a colour. Here's a step-by-step guide of how to build and test this extension.

#### Step 1: Configure the extension

As with all Bolt extensions we need to get started with a configuration `composer.json` file. So we make a new 
directory for our extension called `bolt-colourpicker` and then within the directory type `git init`. This gets us setup
with a clean empty project.

Next comes the configuration, we'll keep things nice and simple so here's the essentials:

```
{
    "name": "bolt/colourpicker",
    "description": "An extension to add a colourpicker as a field type within Bolt",
    "type": "bolt-extension",
    "require": {
        "bolt/bolt": ">2.0,<4.0"
    },
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [{"name": "Ross Riley", "email": "riley.ross@gmail.com"}
    ],

    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Bolt\\Extensions\\Bolt\\Colourpicker\\": "src"
        }
    },
    
    "extra": {
        "bolt-class": "Bolt\\Extensions\\Bolt\\Colourpicker\\Extension",
        "bolt-assets": "assets",
        "bolt-screenshots": ["screenshot.png"]
    }
}

```


The autoload section maps the root of our extension directory to the PHP namespace, if you've not yet used 
PSR-4 autoloading for your PHP code, it's probably good at this point to take a look at some  examples from the 
standard documentation [here][psr4].

Within the extra section we configure two essential bits of information that Bolt uses to run the extension, firstly
the `bolt-class` setting tells Bolt which class can be used to bootstrap this extension. This will be the fully 
qualified class name, but with two back-slashes to separate namespace paths.

Then the `bolt-assets` setting tells Bolt which folder stores assets that need to be publicly available. On install
Bolt will then copy the assets in this folder to an accessible public folder. 


#### The Extension Class

Now it's time for the heavy lifting, we need to write our extension class. To conform to the standard Bolt Extension 
interface we need to extend the utility class `SimpleExtension` and implement a few methods that will define the
features our extension provides.

The most important part is that we will need to extend the built in `ConfigProvider` and add our new field.

First of all, here's the final version of the file that we need to make the extension, then we'll have a quick 
run-through of why we need each of these setup methods.

```
<?php
// File is in src/Extension.php
namespace Bolt\Extensions\Bolt\Colourpicker;

use Bolt\Asset\File\JavaScript;
use Bolt\Asset\File\Stylesheet;
use Bolt\Extension\SimpleExtension;
use Bolt\Extensions\Bolt\Colourpicker\Provider\ConfigProvider;

class Extension extends SimpleExtension
{

    public function getServiceProviders()
    {
        return [
            $this,
            new ConfigProvider()
        ];
    }

    protected function registerTwigPaths()
    {
        return [
            'twig' => ['position' => 'prepend', 'namespace'=>'bolt']
        ];
    }

    protected function registerAssets()
    {
        return [
            new Stylesheet('assets/colourpicker.css'),
            new JavaScript('assets/colourpicker.js'),
            new JavaScript('assets/start.js')
        ];
    }

}

```

Our colourpicker is primarily based on the [jQuery Simple Colorpicker][simple] so we need to add both the css and
javascript assets to the Bolt markup, we also add a `start.js` file which will initalize the javascript.

These are all added in the `registerAssets` method, all this method needs to do is return an array of asset objects
so we make a new object either `new Stylesheet(xxx)` or `new Stylesheets(xxxx)` depending on what we need. These files
are loaded relative to the root of the extension so `assets/colourpicker.css` loads from the `assets` directory.

Next we need to add our own custom field onto the built in field manager. To do this we need to make a provider that
extends the built in `ConfigProvider` we'll come to this provider class shortly, but for now we register it in our
extension class.

This block does just that:

```
public function getServiceProviders()
    {
        return [
            $this,
            new ConfigProvider()
        ];
    }
```

Note that the extension class itself is also a provider so we need to return that first, along with our new provider.


```
if ($this->app['config']->getWhichEnd()=='backend')
```

Finally we want to add our extension's template directory to the system so that Bolt knows it needs to look here for 
extra templates. We do that by returning an array from the `registerTwigPaths()` method. The precise syntax we use is:

```
protected function registerTwigPaths()
{
    return [
        'twig' => ['position' => 'prepend', 'namespace'=>'bolt']
    ];
}
```

The key of this array is the directory we want to add relative to the root of the extension, the value is an array of
options. Both of these settings tell Bolt how and when to load templates from this directory, `position => prepend`
means that this directory takes precedence over the default templates, the namespace is set to `bolt` as the template
we are adding needs to appear in the backend of Bolt and this is the namespace used. If you only want to make
templates available in the frontend then you can omit the namespace.
 
### The Config Provider Class

We now need to extend the built in `ConfigProvider` by making our own provider class, to do this we add a new 
directory inside our `src` folder called `Provider` and the we add the following class.

```
<?php

namespace Bolt\Extensions\Bolt\Colourpicker\Provider;

use Bolt\Config;
use Bolt\Extensions\Bolt\Colourpicker\Field\ColourPickField;
use Silex\Application;
use Silex\ServiceProviderInterface;

class ConfigProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface
{
    public function register(Application $app)
    {

        $app['config'] = $app->share(
            $app->extend(
                'config',
                function (Config $config) {
                    $config->getFields()->addField(new ColourPickField());

                    return $config;
                }
            )
        );

    }


    public function boot(Application $app)
    {
    }
}

```

The main bulk of the class is the Silex `$app->extend` call, this code lets us modify the built in config whenever
a Bolt app is initialized. The important part for our extension is this line: 
`$config->getFields()->addField(new ColourPickField());`
That adds our ColourPickField to the list of available fields. 

#### The Field Class

You can see in the provider class above we added a new instance of ColourPickField to the Bolt field manager. 
Any new field needs to implement the `Bolt\Field\FieldInterface` which has a few fairly simple requirements.

We firstly need to tell Bolt what name the field will use (this is how it will be set in `contenttypes.yml`) and also 
what template will be used to render the field.

Here's the final code for our new field:

```
<?php

namespace Bolt\Extensions\Colourpicker\Field;

use Bolt\Field\FieldInterface;

class ColourPickField implements FieldInterface
{

    public function getName()
    {
        return 'colourpicker';
    }

    public function getTemplate()
    {
        return '_colourpicker.twig';
    }

    public function getStorageType()
    {
        return 'text';
    }

    public function getStorageOptions()
    {
        return array('default'=>'');
    }

}


```



#### The Template File

Finally we need a template file that specifies how our field looks in the
content editor. Here's how our colourpicker template takes shape:

```

{#=== Options ============================================================================#}

{% set attr_opt = {
    class:        field.class|default(''),
    name_id:      key,
    required:     field.required|default(false),
    readonly:     field.readonly|default(false)
}%}

{#=== FIELDSET ============================================================================#}

<fieldset class="colourpicker">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
        <div>
            <label class="control-label">{{field.label|default(key)}}</label>
        </div>
        <select data-colourpicker {{ macro.attr(attr_opt) }}>
            {% for key, value in field.values %}
                {% set isSelected =  (key == context.content.get(key|capitalize)) %}
                <option value="{{key}}"{% if isSelected %} selected="selected"{% endif %}>
                    {{value}}
                </option>
            {% endfor %}
        </select>
    </div>
</fieldset>
```

As you can see the field under the js is a select dropdown of colour options. When you define your own field, all of 
the options specified in `contenttypes.yml` are available within the `field` object. Some of the potential values are 
accessed in the options block. In the case of our colourpicker field, we will look for a list of `values` and use the 
key / value to build the option list.


#### The Final Completed Extension

We now have a completed extension and can add it to our Bolt site. Firstly we
need to add the field to our `contenttypes.yml` file. We add a field like this:

```
    banner:
        type: colourpicker
        label: "Choose A Banner Colour"
        values:
            "#000": Solid Black
            "#E1E1E1": Almost White
            "#444": Dark Grey
            "#FF0011": Bright Red
```
