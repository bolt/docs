Installing Bolt
===============

This page explains the various ways of installing Bolt. You can either use the
command-line or your FTP-client to install it.

There are several methods to install Bolt, but we recommend **the "easiest way"**
[using the server command-line](install-command-line).

Alternatively there are several other methods that may suit your requirements.
  - **The traditional way**, [using (S)FTP](install-sftp).
  - **The nerdy way**, [for developers](install-composer).
  - **The Bolt contributor way**, [for Bolt core development](install-git-clone).

Use one of the three methods described below to get the Bolt source files, and
set them up on your web server.

After you've done this, skip to the section for [Setting up Bolt ](../configuration/introduction).
