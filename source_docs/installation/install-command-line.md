Quick-install, using the command-line
=====================================

If you have command-line access, you can easily install Bolt by executing a few
commands. First, create the directory where you want to install Bolt, if it
doesn't already exist. We recommend installing Bolt outside the web root, you can read more on this **here**. 

Enter the directory, and execute the following commands:

```bash
curl -O http://bolt.cm/distribution/bolt-3.0.0-beta3.tar.gz
tar -xzf bolt-3.0.0-beta3.tar.gz --strip-components=1
```
If this didn't work because your server doesn't have `curl`, use `wget`
instead.

That's all!

Next Steps
----------

### Web server configuration

After extracting the tar file, you'll end up with a structure, similar to this:

```
.
├── app/
├── extensions/
├── public/
├── vendor/
├── README.md
├── composer.json
└── composer.lock
```

These are the folders that contain all of the Bolt code, resources and other
files. Most of them are placed outside of the so-called webroot. Only the
folder `public/` needs to be accessible in the browser.

To do this, configure your webserver to use the `public/` folder as the
webroot. For more information about this, see the pages on configuring
[Apache][apache] or [Nginx][nginx].

If you bump into trouble setting this up, or you have no access to
unchangeable in your web server's configuration, read the page
[Troubleshooting 'outside of the webroot'][webroot].

### Permissions

Generally most server should be fine with the default permissions. However, if
you require guidance on setting up permissions, see our
[File System Permissions](permissions) page.

### Finishing Set-up

After you've done this, skip to the section [Setting up Bolt](../configuration/introduction).
