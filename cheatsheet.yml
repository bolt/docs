relations:
    title: Relationships
    prefix: |
        You can use relationships between records by adding a relation to a ContentType. Relationships are always bidirectional.
    table:
        - [ "Example" ]
        - [ "`relations:`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`pages:`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`multiple: false`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`label: Select a page`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`order: -id`"]  
    postfix: |
        Accessing `record.relation` will give you nothing but the ContentTypes and id’s: `{{ print(record.relation) }}`. To get the actual related records, use `{% set relatedrecords = record.related() %}`.
    links: { "Relationships in the docs": "contenttypes/relationships"}

taxonomies:
    title: Taxonomies and `taxonomy.yml`
    shorttitle: Taxonomies
    prefix: |
        You can create taxonomies by adding them to `taxonomy.yml`. You can define your own taxonomies, and choose how they behave.
    table:
        - [ "Type", "Function" ]
        - [ "`tags`", "Tags are a sort of ‘freeform’ labeling. Each record can have several tags, that do not have to be selected from a predefined list." ]

        - [ "`grouping`", "Grouping is like categories but it is - by definition - more strict. When a grouping applies to a certain record, that record should be viewed as a part of the other records with the same grouping." ]
    links: { "Taxonomies in the docs": "contenttypes/taxonomies"}


permissionsyml:
    title: Permissions and `permissions.yml`
    shorttitle: "Permissions"
    prefix: |
        The permissions needed to perform an action are configurable by editing `app/config/permissions.yml`.
        This can be done either directly, or through Bolt’s back-end UI. By changing the permissions you basically change the way
        how people can interact with Bolt, and who is allowed to do what.
    links: { "Permissions in the docs": "configuration/permissions"}


routing:
    title: Routing and `routing.yml`
    shorttitle: "Routing"
    prefix: |
        Bolt allows you to configure the routing to your needs. This basically
        means that you can configure Bolt to generate and interpret URLs the way
        you need them to be. There are some caveats with regards to correct
        canonical URLs, but otherwise you can change it to anything you like.
        The easiest way to add your own is to follow the examples defined in the
        distributed `routing.yml.dist` file. The order of the routes is important
        because it is routing is done on a first-come first-serve basis.

twiginclude:

    shorttitle: Template includes
    prefix: |
        Use this to include another Twig template in the current template.
        Twig parses the template like any other template, so you can use any
        tags in your included template that you would use in the ‘main’
        template. You can also use `include` inside the included templates."

    table_linear: true
    postfix: |
        An alternative to using 'include', is to set up your templates using Template
        Inheritance. This is a method of defining a base template, and then expand it in
        more detail in the templates that extend this base template. See the section on
        [Template inheritance](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html#template-inheritance) on the twig website.

        Filters in twig look like this: `{{ 'foo'|filter }}`, and can take
        optional parameters. A filter basically transforms whatever you put into
        it, so it can be processed further. Filters can be chained together, for
        example: `{{ record.title|excerpt(20)|lower }}`.

        - [ '`ucfirst(string)`', "Make a string's first character uppercase." ]
