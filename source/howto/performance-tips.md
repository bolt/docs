Performance and finetuning for Bolt websites
============================================

This page contains a few tips and pointers to optimize and tune your Bolt website when putting it
'live'. When developing Bolt, you usually have different settings than you would use in a
production environment.

Use `config_local.yml`
----------------------

Regardless of how you 'deploy' a site with Bolt, you've undoubtedly bumped into the nuisance of
keeping environment specific settings in sync between your development version, and the 'live'
production site. To make this a bit easier, you can use a `config_local.yml`, that you can place
right next to the 'regular' `config.yml`. Any setting you make in this file, will _overrule_ a
setting made in `config.yml`.

If you use a versioning tool like Git, you can put the `config.yml` file into the repository, but
you shouldn't commit `config_local.yml`. This way you can bring most of the configuration under
versioning control, but your database credential isn't included.

You can edit this file through the Bolt backend as well, just like the regular config. To get there, use the button on the edit screen for `config.yml`:

Disable debug
-------------

Disable the debug toolbar, that gets appended to every page request. This toolbar shows a _lot_ of
useful information, but once a website is put into production, you should turn this funtionality
off:

```
debug: false
```

Doing this shaves a few milliseconds off each request, so your site will become slightly faster.

The debug information is not visible to visitors who aren't logged in, but it's good practice to
take extra precautions by disabling the toolbar.

Make sure `debuglog` is disabled as well, and Bolt is set to display no errors. We do this, so that
whenever something bad happens (like a database that crashes, or the server has some malfunction),
no sensitive information will be shown to the visitors of the site.

```
debug_error_level: 0 

debuglog:
  enabled: false
```

Check mail settings
-------------------

Be sure to set up the mail settings correctly. If your site has any forms, make sure they still
work. If possible, use a proper 'smtp' server, instead of PHP's plain 'mail()' fallback.


Set up thumbs
-------------

You can configure Bolt to save all requested thumbnails as files. To enable this feature, do the
following:

 - Create a folder `thumbs` in the root of your website, and make sure it's writable to the web
   server.
 - Set `save_files: true` in the `thumbnails:` section of `config.yml`.

Doing this means that thumbnails will be saved as actual files, with the exact same name as will
show up in the url. By default Bolt caches the results of each 'thumbnail' request, so it doesn't
have to resize images on each request, but there _is_ a certain overhead in this. If files are
saved to `thumbs/`, any request to a thumbnail that's cached completely bypasses the PHP layer
entirely, which uses significantly less resources on the server.

Configure the backend path and other branding
---------------------------------------------

The default path to the Bolt backend is `/bolt`, but this can be configured in `config.yml`. Doing
this has a tiny benefit when it comes to security, because bots and crawlers won't be able to use
the default location to try for passwords, but it also looks professional, for your clients.

The news shown on the dashboard can be pulled from an alternate source. Check http://news.bolt.cm/
for an example of how this source should look. If you use the bolt JSON extension (bolt/jsonaccess)
as the source for the news you will also need to fill out the news_variable.

You can also customize the backend favicon and the various apple-touch-icons.

```
branding:
  name: Bolt
  path: /admin
  provided_by: [ supercool@example.org, "Supercool Webdesign Co." ]
  news_source: http://news.example.org
  news_variable: news
  favicon: /files/icons/favicon.ico
  apple-touch-icon: /files/icons/apple-touch-icon.png
  apple-touch-icon-72x72: /files/icons/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png
  apple-touch-icon-114x114: /files/icons/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png
  apple-touch-icon-144x144: /files/icons/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png
```

This is what it will look like in the Bolt backend:

Make sure Google can find the site
----------------------------------

If you've used a `robots.txt` to prevent Google from indexing the development version of the site,
make sure it's disabled in production.

To further increase the correct indexing of your site, make sure you have a `sitemap.xml`, and that
your HTML contains the required meta tags. Two extensions to help with this are:

 - [Bolt SEO extension](http://extensions.bolt.cm/view/3cda7d7e-09e9-11e5-9120-621e70d6e3eb)
 - [Sitemap](http://extensions.bolt.cm/view/e89b81c7-bbd3-4221-82b9-070ba6680c45)

If your site is accessible on more than one URL, or just with and without the 'www.'-prefix, you should set the canonical manually, to prevent duplicate content in Google: 

```
canonical: www.example.org
```

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Combining the tips mentioned above, here's a full example of what your `config_local.yml` could contain. 

```
