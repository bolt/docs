Locales
=======

In the `config.yml`-file you can set the Locale to be used by Bolt. A locale is a set of parameters that defines the
used language, country and any special variant preferences that are used in Bolt's frontend.

Currently, the locale settings are only used for date formatting on the Frontend of your site, but we're looking into
adding localization features for other parts of the Frontend and the Backend as well.

The Locale setting is defined in the `config.yml`-file like this:

<pre class="brush:plain">
locale: en_GB
</pre>

As you can see, the locale consists of two parts: The language part, and the country part. In some cases the codes are
the same, like `nl_NL` for Dutch/Netherlands. In other cases they are different, like `en_US` for English/United 
States. Which values are supported depends on your server settings, so you might have to try which setting works best for you. Some common options are:

<pre class="brush:plain">
    Locale   Language             Country  
    en_US    English              United States                              en   US

A much longer list of possible options can be found here: [List of Locales, languages and
countrycodes](https://github.com/bobdenotter/locales/blob/master/locales_list.txt).

Bolt's `localdate()` function and filter uses the setting from `config.yml` to set the language for the date formatting. For an overview of the options, see php.net's [strftime page](http://php.net/strftime), and the documentation section on [localdate()](/templatetags#filter-localdate).
