Welcome to the Bolt user manual
===============================

Bolt is a tool for Content Management, which strives to be as simple and
straightforward as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses
elegant templates, and above all: it's a joy to use. Bolt is created using
modern Open Source libraries, and is best suited to build sites in HTML5, with
modern markup.

Basically, there are three groups of users we've created Bolt for:

 - End users (read 'editors') that want to focus on producing and editing
   content, and not on clicking buttons in the CMS. This is the group that
   this manual is for.
 - Front-end designers and developers who like to write clean markup, and who
   want to build websites where the CMS doesn't dictate what the templates or
   site should look like. This group probably want to look at the
   [documentation](https://docs.bolt.cm/) after looking through this manual.
 - Developers who need a system that's easy to set up and configure, that's
   easy to manage and maintain, but is also flexible and versatile. This group
   probably want to skip to the [documentation](https://docs.bolt.cm/).
