Installing Bolt
===============

This page explains the various ways of installing Bolt. You can either use the
command-line or your FTP-client to install it. There are different methods to
install Bolt, but we recommend the **Composer-based distribution** as the
fastest way to get an installation of Bolt up and running.

distribution files</small> </a>

Additionally, there are several installation options that suit any preferred workflow:

  - **[Using 'composer create-project'][create-project]**: Use our
    `composer create-project` installation method from the command for the
    greatest flexibility over folder structure in your project.
  - **[Creating your own Bootstrap][custom-bootstrap]**: You can bootstrap the
    Bolt application in custom code, in order to integrate it fully into an
    existing project.
  - **[Manual download and extraction][sftp]**: Downloading the distribution
    file as a `.zip` or `.tgz` file. Use this to manually extract and upload
    using a traditional method like (S)FTP.

Use one of the four methods described above to get the Bolt source files, and
set them up on your web server. After you've done this, skip to the section for
[Setting up Bolt][configuration].
