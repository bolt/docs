Installing Bolt
===============

With the release of Bolt 4 stable, there will be a number of ways to install
the application. For now, we recommend the **composer create-project** as the
fastest way to get an installation of Bolt up and running. If you don't have
composer yet, see [here][get-composer].

Set up a new Bolt 4 project, using the following command, replacing `myprojectname`
with your desired project's name.

```bash
composer create-project bolt/project myprojectname
```



Navigate into the newly created folder, and configure the database in `.env`:

```dotenv
# SQLite
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data/bolt.sqlite

# MySQL
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:"root%1"@127.0.0.1:3306/four
```

Set up the database, create the first user and add fixtures (dummy content):

```bash
bin/console bolt:setup
```

Run Bolt using the built-in webserver, Symfony CLI, Docker or your own
preferred webserver:

```bash
bin/console server:start
```

or…

```bash
symfony server:start -d
symfony open:local
```

or…

```bash
make docker-install
```

Finally, open the new installation in a browser. If you've used one of the
commands above, you'll find the frontpage at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The Bolt admin panel can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8000/bolt

Log in using the credentials you created when setting up the first user.
