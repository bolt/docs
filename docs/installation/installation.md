Installing Bolt
===============

With the stable release of Bolt 4, there will be a number of ways to install
the application. For now, we recommend the **composer create-project** as the
fastest way to get an installation of Bolt up and running.

What is **composer** you may ask? It is a dependency manager for PHP, or in
other words it helps you manage the third-party libraries and tools, such as
Bolt itself, that your project relies on.

## Step 1: Make sure you have composer installed.

If you don't have composer installed yet, see [here][get-composer].

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This documentation makes the assumption
that you're setting up Bolt on a local development machine. Not on the server
where you intend to run a production website. If you do not have a local
development environment, we recommend taking the time to set this up. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> This documentation makes the assumption
that you know how to run composer on your machine. If not, the quickest way
to get started is to follow the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md"
 target="_blank">composer getting started</a> section of the composer documentation.</p>

## Step 2: Set up a new Bolt project

Open the command line (command prompt on Windows) and go to the folder
inside of which you want to create your new Bolt project.

Set up a new Bolt 4 project, using the following command, replacing
`myprojectname` with your desired project's name.

```bash
composer create-project bolt/project myprojectname
```

## Step 3 (optional): Configure the database

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This step is optional. If you are not
sure about setting up a database connection, you can leave this step out. Bolt
will automatically use a default SQLite database without further configuration
needed.</p>
Navigate into the newly created folder, and configure the database in `.env` or
your environment variables, replacing `db_user`, `db_password` and `db_name`
where appropriate:

```env
# SQLite (note: _three_ slashes)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data/bolt.sqlite

# MYSQL / MariaDB
#DATABASE_URL="mysql://db_user:db_password@localhost:3306/db_name"
```

<!-- # Postgres
#DATABASE_URL=postgresql://db_user:"db_password"@localhost:5432/db_name?serverVersion=11" -->

You can read more information about [configuring the database here][db-setup].

## Step 4: Initialise your new project

Run `bin/console bolt:setup`. This will create
and initialise the Database for you, then lets you create the first (admin)
user, and add some dummy content ("fixtures") to the database.

Alternatively, run the following commands in sequence to do it step by step:

```bash
# In one go
bin/console bolt:setup

# As separate steps
bin/console doctrine:database:create
bin/console doctrine:schema:create
bin/console bolt:add-user --admin
bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Depending on your configuration and what
webserver you're going to use, you might need to set some permissions on a
number of files and folders. Read more about it on the <a href="./permissions">
File system permissions</a> page.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to create at least one
<strong>admin</strong> user, using either <code>bolt:setup</code> or by
running <code>bin/console bolt:setup --admin</code>. Otherwise, you 
won't be able to log into the backend.</p>

## Step 5: Start the server to view your new site

Start PHP's built-in webserver by running:

```bash
bin/console server:start
```

After it runs, you will see a message similar to this:

```bash
 [OK] Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000                           
```

Open up a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view your new
Bolt project. To access the Bolt Editor, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/bolt`.

Starting a webserver (additional tips)
--------------------

This section gives you additional options on configuring the web server to
run your Bolt project.

You can run Bolt locally using the built-in webserver, [Symfony CLI][cli],
Docker or your own preferred webserver. If you choose to set up a web server
yourself, you can either set up something like [Mamp, Xampp, Laragon][local] or
otherwise there's docs for [Apache][apache] and [Nginx][nginx].

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The folder you've just created has a
<code>public/</code> folder. This is the actual web root of the site. If you're
not using one of the options below, but are configuring a webserver yourself,
make sure you use <code>public/</code> as the web root. Bolt does <em>not</em>
support putting all of its files inside the webroot itself, as that is
considered to be a bad practice.</p>

Start PHP's built-in webserver…

```bash
bin/console server:start
```

or use the Symfony CLI ([download here][cli]) …

```bash
symfony serve -d
symfony open:local
```

or use Docker…

```bash
make docker-install
```

Finally, open the new installation in a browser. If you've used one of the
commands above, you'll find the frontpage at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The Bolt admin panel can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8000/bolt

Log in using the credentials you created when setting up the first user.
