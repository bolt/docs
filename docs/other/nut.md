title: Nut (command line utility)
---
The command line utility Nut
============================

Bolt comes with a small command line utility, named `nut`, that can be found in
the `app/`-folder. If you are familiar with working on the commandline, you can
some tasks like 'clearing the cache' or 'updating the database' without having
to use the webinterface of Bolt. This utility is completely optional, so if you
don't have access to the command line on your server, you're not missing out on
any essential functionality. It's merely a convenient tool for those that do
prefer the command line.

Right now, there are a few basic commands, but we're going to add more and more
over time.

When running `php app/nut` without any parameters, you'll see the help screen:
