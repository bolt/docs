Configuring the Database
========================

Bolt supports three different database engines: SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Each has its benefits and drawbacks.

  - **SQLite** - is a (file-based) database. Bolt stores the entire database as
    a file in the `app/database` directory. Since it's a regular file, it's
    easy to make backups of your database if you use SQLite. The main benefit
    of SQLite is that it requires no configuration, and as such, it works 'out
    of the box' on practically any web server. This is why it's Bolt's default
    choice.
  - **MySQL** - is perhaps the most well-known database engine, which is
    supported on the majority of web servers. MySQL is very well-known, and there
    are good third-party tools for maintenance, backup and migration.
  - **PostgreSQL** - is a very well-designed database engine, but not as widely
    available as MySQL.

Not sure which database to use? We suggest using MySQL if available, and SQLite
otherwise.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you've just installed Bolt, you might
not have the <code>config.yml</code>-file in <code>app/config</code> yet. You
will however have a <code>config.yml.dist</code>-file, in that same directory.
The first time Bolt is run, the <code>.yml.dist</code>-files will be
automatically copied to <code>.yml</code>-files. If you wish to do some
configuration <em>before</em> you first run Bolt, just copy
<code>config.yml.dist</code> to <code>config.yml</code> manually.</p>

If you wish to edit the database configuration, you have to change the settings
in `app/config/config.yml`. Apart from SQLite, you can use MySQL and PostgreSQL
as database systems. Set the database, username and password:

```yaml
database:
    driver: mysql
    username: bolt
    password: password
    databasename: bolt
```

or:

```yaml
database:
    driver: postgres
    username: bolt
    password: password
    databasename: bolt
```

Support for PostgreSQL is experimental, so use with caution.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The config file is in the YAML format,
  which means that the indentation is important. Make sure you leave leading
  spaces intact.</p>

If the hostname or port are something else than `localhost:3306`, you can add them like
this:

```yaml
database:
    driver: mysql
    username: bolt
    password: password
    databasename: bolt
    host: database.example.org
    port: 3306
```

The default prefix for the database tables is `bolt_`. You can change this with the `prefix` option like so:
```yaml
database:
    driver: mysql
    username: bolt
    password: password
    databasename: bolt
    prefix: yourapp
```

Other settings in the `config.yml` file can be changed later on, directly from
the Bolt backend.

Open your Bolt site in your browser, and you should be greeted by the screen to
set up the first user. Do so, and log in to the Bolt Backend. You should now
see the (empty) Dashboard screen, and you'll be able to add some dummy pages,
using the built-in Loripsum tool. After you've done this, you should see some
dummy content, and you're good to go!
