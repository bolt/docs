Introduction
============

This is the Bolt Documentation. There are a lot of docs for Bolt, so it is
split up in a few parts. If you're new to Bolt, you'll find a few of the most
used pages linked below. The menu on the left lists all the sections in a
tree-like structure. If you're looking for something specific, use the search
option in the top left of the screen.
