References & Documentation for Core Development
===============================================

This section aims to provide helpful information for people contributing to the
development of Bolt.

If you plan on working on the Bolt core code, we recommend forking and cloning
the `bolt/bolt` repository from GitHub.

See the ["Clone the Git Repository"][clone] section for details on cloning.
