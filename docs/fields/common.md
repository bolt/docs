Common options for all fields
=========


All fields have few common options to further customize them. We explain them
in more detail below.

  - `label`: If omitted, the name of the field will be used as a label in
    the edit-screen. Replace 'Foo' with the desired label of the field.
  - `group`: Group the field under a certain tab when editing.
  - `prefix`: Text/HTML to show before the field.
  - `postfix`: Text/HTML to show after the field.
  - `info`: Use for displaying extra information about the field in a info
     popup besides the label.
  - `default`: The default value for a field, if applicable.
  - `required`: make this field required so that the record cannot be
    saved without it being filled.
  - `pattern`: Add a custom validation pattern to validate against when saving.
  - `readonly`: Do not allow an editor to change the value of this field.
  - `index`: Add a database index for this field, only add if you know
    what this means.

### Grouping fields in tabs


If you have a number of fields in your ContentType, it might be convenient to
add grouping to the fields, by using tabs. It will look like this:

<a href="/files/contenttype-tabs.png" class="popup"><img src="/files/contenttype-tabs.png"></a>

To do this, simply add `group` to the fields that you would like to place under
a certain tab. You don't need to specify _all_ of the fields with a grouping,
just the ones that are the first on a tab. Any subsequent fields without a
specified `group` will fall under the previously set grouping.

For example:

```apache
pages:
    name: Pages
    singular_name: Page
    fields:
        title:
            type: text
            class: large
            group: content
        slug:
            type: slug
            uses: title
        body:
            type: html
        image:
            type: image
            group: media
        file:
            type: file
        ..
```

### Prefix and Postfix

Sometimes it can be beneficial to add some extra text, labels or other markup
to how a field is displayed in the Bolt backend, when editing a record. You can
use the optional `prefix` and `postfix` values to add some markup before or
after a field. For example:

```apache
        subtitle:
            type: text
            class: large
            prefix: "<p>Add a subtitle, if you want.</p>"
            postfix: "<hr>"
```

As you can see, using `postfix: "<hr>"` gives a simple and effective way of
adding a divider in the edit screen.

### Info

In the case where you want to provide a large volume of informational text
about the use and purpose of a field, the value of the `info` parameter can be
used.

The info paramter will place a button beside the field label that, when hovered
over, will display a popup with the info text.

For fields that have an info button by default (e.g. `image` field), the info
description will override that field type default.

### Default values

When you want to give a record a default value, use `default:`. For most fields
this will set the initial value of the field, when you're creating a new record
of this ContentType. For `date` and `datetime` fields, the value is passed
through [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php), meaning
that you can use a fixed date as default, like "1900-01-01 12:00:00", but also
relative dates like "first day of this month", "next Monday" or "yesterday".

### Required and patterns

You can use the `required` option to make a field required. Combine it with the
`pattern` option to make sure that a field contains an email-address, or that a
title is no longer than a certain amount of characters. Note that the
requirements are only enforced in the browser, so don't "trust" any data that's
been entered by an editor. When a field does not validate, a default message is
shown that, *"the x field is required or needs to match a pattern"*. You can
set a custom error message for a field with the error option. for example
`error: "The title field is required and must be no longer than 40 characters"`

Currently, you can use the `required` option for fields of type `text`,
`textarea`, `html`, `date`, `datetime`, `float` and `integer`.

For example, to make a title required, you can do this:

```apache
        title:
            type: text
            prefix: "<p>A title is required.</p>"
            required: true
            class: large
```

If combined with a `pattern`, you can add frontend validation to the field. By
doing this, you can require that the values of a field are within certain
parameters. You can use either one of the predetermined patterns like `email`
or `url`, or any regular expression. Currently, the `pattern` option is only
available for `text` fields. Examples of patterns that can be used, can be
found on the website [html5pattern.com](http://html5pattern.com/). Some common
use-cases are:

- `email`: the input must be a valid email address. The email address must be
  _possible_ syntactically, but it's not required that it actually exists.
- `url`: the input must be a valid url, starting with `http://` or `https://`.
  The URL address must be _possible_ syntactically, but it's not required that
  it actually exists.
- `^.{1,50}$`: The input can contain any character, and should be between 1 and
  50 characters in length.
- `^[0-9_ -]*$`: The input can contain numbers, dashes, underscores and spaces.
- `^[a-zA-Z0-9 ]{10,20}$`: The input can contain uppercase and lowercase
  letters and numbers, and should be between 10 and 20 characters in length.
- `^[1-9][0-9]{3}[\s]?[A-Za-z]{2}$`: The input should be a Dutch postal code:
  four numbers with no leading '0', an optional space, and two letters. `1234
  ab` or `2518HL` are valid inputs.

For example, use this to make sure a title is no longer than 80 characters:

```yaml
        title:
            type: text
            prefix: "<p>A title is required. The maximum length is 80 characters</p>"
            required: true
            pattern: "^.{1,80}$"
            class: large
```

The `^` and `$` in some of the examples note the beginning and end of the value
respectively. If we would omit these, the results would be off. For example,
`.{1,10}` would match any value that has "between 1 and 10 characters" in it,
regardless of what comes before or after it. Probably not what you're looking
for.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You should not try to use a pattern to
match an email address. Always use <code>email</code> to validate an email
address.</p>

You can also define fields that are not required, but that _do_ have a pattern.
Doing this, the field can be left blank, but if it _is_ filled, it must match
the pattern. For example, you could make an optional email-address like this:

```apache
        person:
            type: text
            prefix: "<p>An optional email address.</p>"
            required: false
            pattern: email
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a required field, you should
always include a postfix. Otherwise the editor might not know what's expected
of them. </p>

### Readonly fields

You can use the `readonly` option to lock the content in a field. For example
if you have generated some entries with an import that users should not change.
You can combine it with the `default` option to make sure that a field contains
something. The readonly status is only enforced in the browser, so don't
"trust" any data that's been entered by an editor.

```apache
        serialnumber:
            type: text
            default: "SN-123456789"
            readonly: true
```
