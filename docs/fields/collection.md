Collection field
==============

A special field type available as a field definition is the `collection` field
type which allows you to compose an array-like structure of sub-fields within a
single field.
<!-- note: by including the old / officious name, it can be found using search. -->
<!-- block repeater -->

## Basic Configuration:

The configuration of a repeating field comprises the main field name,
along with the definition of the sub fields under the `fields` key.

```yaml
        features:
            type: collection
            fields:
                featuretitle:
                    type: text
                featureimage:
                    type: image
                    extensions: [ gif, jpg, png ]
                featurecontent:
                    type: html
```

As you can see the field is configured with a type of `collection` and then the sub-fields
are configured under the `fields` attribute. You can include any valid fields
within a collection, there are a few that are not supported.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Collections are usable with most of the
available field types, except where
it simply does not make sense to have more than one of. In short, do
<strong>not</strong> use <code>type: slug</code>, <code>type: collection</code> or
<code>type: templateselect</code> as fields in
your collection. These fields will not work as expected. </p>

You can move and sort fields inside collections, but don't forget to save your record after sorting.

## Example usage in templates:

When you want to use collections in your templates you will need to iterate over
the collection in order to access the individual fields.

For instance if you just want to iterate over all fields in the order they are saved then the template code will look like this:

```twig
    {% for feature in record.features %}

        {{ feature.type }}:

        {% if feature.type in ['text', 'html', 'textarea', 'markdown'] %}
            {{ feature|raw }}
        {% elseif feature.type == 'image' %}
            {{ showimage(feature) }}
        {% else %}
            {{ dump(feature) }}
        {% endif %}

    {% endfor %}
```

In the example above using `{{ feature }}` will just output the value of the
sub-field, if it is a text field such as like `text`, `html`, `textarea` or
`markdown`. Since these are sometimes more complex fields you can use
`{{ thumbnail(field) }}` or `{{ showimage(field) }}` for images or
`{{ dump(field.value) }}` to dump the field (with value) regardless of type.

If you know the names of the fields you want to render then you can fetch the
fields from the collection by name or by type. Because of the nature of a Collection Field, we shouldn't assume by default there's only one field of type text, or even that there's only one field named "introduction".

In that light, it's usually good practice to always use a for loop to iterate over them. The examples below will grab the fields named `content` or all of the `type: text` fields. We do this with Twig's [`filter` filter][filter]

```twig
{% for feature in record.features|filter(feature => feature.name == 'featurecontent') %}
    {{ feature }}
{% endfor %}

{% for feature in record.features|filter(feature => feature.type == 'text') %}
    {{ feature }}
{% endfor %}
```

If you're certain a collection has one field of a type or name, you can avoid the for loops. For instance using the same example as above but knowing that our collection comprises the individual sub-fields
`companyname`, `telephone` and `email` we can output the fields like this:

```twig
{% set companyname = record.features|filter(f => f.name == 'companyname')|first %}
{% set telephone = record.features|filter(f => f.name == 'telephone')|first %}
{% set email = record.features|filter(f => f.name == 'email')|first %}

Name: {{ companyname }}
Telephone: {{ telephone }}
Email: {{ email }}
```

## Options

The field has three specific options:

* `limit`: Limit how many collection items an editor is able to create. If you omit this
  setting, then an unlimited number of sets can be created. The configuration
  for that option looks like this:

```yaml
        features:
            type: collection
            limit: 3
            collapsible: false
            fields:
                featuretitle:
                    type: text
                featureimage:
                    type: image
                    extensions: [ gif, jpg, png ]
                featurecontent:
                    type: html
```

* `default_state`: Whether the separate collection items of this Collections are collapsed in
  the backend. This allows the editor to get a better overview, if there are
  multiple collection items. The default is `collapsed`, you can set it to `expanded` to disable
  this feature.
* `default`: The default field option is also supported for a collection field. See the example
  for how to configure a default value for collections.

```yaml
        features:
            type: collection
            fields:
                featuretitle:
                    type: text
                featurecontent:
                    type: html
                featureimage:
                    type: image
            default:
                0:
                    field: featuretitle
                    default: "Lets start with a title"
                1:
                    field: featureimage
                    default:
                        filename: "kitten.jpg"
                        alt: "Picture of a kitten"
                2:
                    field: featurecontent
                    default: "<strong>Finish strong</strong> after the kitten with some content"
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To set the default items inside a collection, you <strong>must</strong>
set the field name in the <code>field</code> config (e.g. <code>field: title</code>) and the default value for that item,
e.g. <code>default: "Lets start with a title"`</code>.
What is inside the item <code>default</code> will depend on the field type.</p>
