Repeater field
==============

A special field type available as a field definition is the `repeater` field type which
allows you to compose an array-like structure of sub-fields within a single field name.

### Basic Configuration:

The configuration of a repeating field set comprises the main field set name, along with
the definition of the sub fields.

```yaml
        features:
            type: repeater
            fields:
                repeattitle:
                    type: text
                repeatimage:
                    type: image
                    extensions: [ gif, jpg, png ]
                repeatcontent:
                    type: html
```

As you can see the field is configured with a type of `repeater` and then the sub-fields 
are configured under the `fields` attribute. In general you can include any valid fields
within a repeater, there are a few that are not supported `slug`, `templatefield` and 
`repeater` itself.

### Example usage in templates:

When you want to use repeaters in your templates you will need to iterate over
a set before you can access the individual fields.

The approach you use may vary slightly on whether you know the names of the
fields within each set or if you want to allow your template to iterate over
all the sub-fields without necessarily knowing the field names.

For instance if you just want to iterate over all sets and then all fields
within the set then the template code will look like this:

```twig
{% for feature in record.features %}
    {% for field in feature %}
        {{ field }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

In the example above using `{{ field }}` will just output the string value of 
the sub-field but since these are sometimes more complex fields you can use the
techniques described in the section below for individual fields to output the
specific type of field in the layout you require.

If you know the names of the fields you want to render then you can fetch a
field from the collection by name. For instance using the same example as above
but knowing that our repeat set comprises the individual sub-fields
`companyname`, `telephone` and `email` we can output the fields like this:

```twig
{% for company in record.companies %}
    <h2>{{ company.get('companyname') }}</h2>
    <h4>Tel: {{ company.get('telephone') }}</h4>
    <h4>Email: <a href="mailto:{{ company.get('email') }}">{{ company.get('email') }}</a></h4>
    <hr>
{% endfor %}
```

If you prefer the dot-notation to access field values, you can also omit the `get()` function.

```twig
{% for company in record.companies %}
    <h2>{{ company.companyname }}</h2>
    <h4>Tel: {{ company.telephone }}</h4>
    <h4>Email: <a href="mailto:{{ company.email }}">{{ company.email }}</a></h4>
    <hr>
{% endfor %}
```

### Images and thumbnails

You can use the image- and thumbnail filters for images inside a repeater contenttype, but the notation is slightly different.

```twig
        <img src="{{ sectie.get('repeatimage')|image(1200, 800, "r") }}" alt="{{ sectie.get('repeatimage').title }}">
```

### Options

The field has a one option to change the functionality of the field.

* `limit`: Define a limit to how many sets an editor is able to create. If you
  omit this setting then an unlimited number of sets can be created. The
  configuration for that looks like this:

```yaml
        features:
            type: repeater
            limit: 3
            fields:
                repeattitle:
                    type: text
                repeatimage:
                    type: image
                    extensions: [ gif, jpg, png ]
                repeatcontent:
                    type: html
```
